# Welcome to the Through the Woods Github!

As a preface, since this would be the first time I had done any major scripting, I followed two Brackeys tutorials.
those scripts were:

*2D Character Controller*

*A** *Pathfinding*

All other scripts were done using the skills I had learned while working on the project and looking up solutions.
